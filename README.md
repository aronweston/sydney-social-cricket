# Project 1: Social Cricket Sydney

[Project Link](https://project1sydcricket.herokuapp.com/)

### Idea

The idea behind this project was to create a directory and membership site similar to a social cricket site I used to be a member of when at university in Canberra, called [ACT Social Cricket](https://actsocialcricket.com/). However, I wanted it to be an interactive platform that players and teams could see games, other players and other teams.


## Instructions



## Features

1. Teams and players can both sign up and login with their respective details
2. Players can view a team profile and join that team
3. A team can only have 20 players and can not be joined after it has been reached
4. Players has login with Google (coming soon for teams)
5. A team can create games between other teams

### Database Design

**Players:** A player has one team and a team has many players

| ID      | first_name | last_name | role              | grade  | suburb    | bio                 | profile_image | banner_photo | team_id | is_admin | email          | password_digest |
| ------- | ---------- | --------- | ----------------- | ------ | --------- | ------------------- | ------------- | ------------ | ------- | -------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| integer | text       | text      | text              | string | text      | text                | text          | text         | int     | boolean  | text           | string          |

**Teams**: A team has many players, but a player only has one team

| ------- | --------- | ----- | ------------ | ----- | ---------------------------------- | ------------ |
| integer | text      | text  | text         | text  | text                               | integer      |
| 1       | Fun Times | Smith | img(src)     | A     | Good team of blokes, can't bat bat | 20           |

**Games**: a game can only have 2 teams but a team can have many games

| ID      | team_1_id | team_2_id | ground_id | date    |
| ------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | ------- |
| integer | text      | text      | text      | date    |

**Grounds**: a ground can have many games but a game can only have one ground. Only admins can create grounds
